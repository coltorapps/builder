## Overview

**Builder** is a versatile React and React Native library designed for crafting dynamic form builders and much more. You can also develop dynamic website builders, dashboard builders, and any other builders you envision.

Some key characteristics:

- Headless: Bring your own components and design the user experience as you want.
- Full-stack: Provides comprehensive tools for building both the interface and validate schemas on the back-end.
- Typesafe: Ensures full type safety by default in every aspect.
- Multi-platform: Runs on web (React), mobile (React Native), servers, serverless, and workers.
- Framework agnostic: Features a core that is independent of any front-end framework.
- Zero dependencies: Offers a streamlined, lightweight library.
- Unopinionated: Affords you the freedom to build anything you imagine.
- Progressively Enhanceable: Embraces web standards.

Currently, **Builder** offers support for React and React Native, with plans to extend compatibility to other front-end frameworks in the future.
